# CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application

## Project Overview
This project implements a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for a Node.js web application using Jenkins and Docker. The pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment processes within a containerized environment, utilizing Docker-In-Docker (DinD) technology.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A Linux server running Ubuntu 20.04 (or similar).
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- A personal GitHub account.

## Project Structure
- **Project2Compose**: Repository for Docker Compose configuration.
- **aws-elastic-beanstalk-express-js-sample**: Forked repository containing the Node.js web application.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repositories
Clone the repositories to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hirdyasharma/aws-elastic-beanstalk-express-js-sample.git
git clone https://github.com/hirdyasharma/Project2Compose.git
```
*Comments: Cloning the repositories gives you access to both the Node.js application and the Docker Compose configuration.*

### Step 2: Set Up Docker Compose
Navigate to the `Project2Compose` directory and run Docker Compose to start Jenkins and DinD:
```bash
cd Project2Compose  # Change to the Docker Compose directory
docker-compose up -d  # Start Jenkins and DinD containers in detached mode
```
*Comments: This command launches Jenkins in a Docker container along with the Docker-In-Docker service, allowing Jenkins to run Docker commands.*

### Step 3: Access Jenkins
Open your web browser and navigate to Jenkins:
```plaintext
http://<your-server-ip>:8080  # Replace <your-server-ip> with your server's IP address
```
*Comments: Access Jenkins through the web interface to set up your pipeline.*

### Step 4: Configure Jenkins Pipeline
1. **Create a New Pipeline Project**:
   - In Jenkins, click on "New Item."
   - Enter a name for your project (e.g., `StudentID_Project2_pipeline`) and select "Pipeline."
   - Click "OK."

2. **Configure the Pipeline**:
   - Scroll down to the "Pipeline" section.
   - Select "Pipeline script from SCM."
   - Choose "Git" as your SCM.
   - Enter the repository URL for your forked Node.js application:
     ```plaintext
     https://github.com/hirdyasharma/aws-elastic-beanstalk-express-js-sample.git
     ```
   - Set the branch to `main` (or your default branch).
   - Click "Save."

*Comments: This sets up Jenkins to use the `Jenkinsfile` from your Node.js application repository for the CI/CD pipeline.*

### Step 5: Run the Pipeline
1. **Trigger the Pipeline**:
   - In the Jenkins dashboard, click on your newly created project.
   - Click on "Build Now" to run the pipeline.
   
2. **Monitor the Pipeline**:
   - Click on the build number (e.g., #1) to see the build details.
   - Check the console output for logs and execution status.

*Comments: This starts the CI/CD process, executing the steps defined in the `Jenkinsfile`.*

### Step 6: Review Pipeline Logs
- After the pipeline runs, review the logs for any errors or important messages.
- Take screenshots of the successful pipeline execution and logs for documentation.

*Comments: Reviewing logs helps ensure that all steps executed successfully and helps identify any potential issues.*

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to implement a CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using Jenkins and Docker. The automated pipeline streamlines the development and deployment process, adhering to modern DevOps practices.
